<p>This vignette details the specific structure of exported Canvas
files. For information on how to use Canvas grade data with Gradebook,
view the <a href="https://gradebook-dev.github.io/gradebook/articles/working-with-canvas-data.html">Working
With Canvas Data</a> vignette instead. This vignette details in depth
information about Canvas file exports for curious advanced users.</p>
<p>There are many exports from Canvas: Canvas divides student
information into multiple separate csv exports as compared to the
singular Gradescope csv. Currently, there are three relevant csv
exports: grades.csv, lateness.csv, and roster.csv.</p>
<p>Here is information about the data formatting of each csv:</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="grades-csv">Grades.csv:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#grades-csv"></a>
</h2>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="id-columns">ID Columns:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#id-columns"></a>
</h3>
<p>Student - This gives the student name in format Last, First
(different than Gradescope)</p>
<p>ID - This gives the student’s Canvas ID. It is the primary key is
Canvas and thus the best choice when joining canvas dataframes</p>
<p>SIS User ID - The SIS is the name of the system that Canvas
interfaces with for each individual university that uses Canvas. For
example, Berkeley’s SIS is CalCentral. This has been confirmed by Canvas
Employees. Thus, SIS User ID is the student’s Cal ID for our university.
Typically this will be the desired primary key for operations outside of
Gradebook. Note that, like Gradescope, SIS User ID will contain some
entries of the form “UID: #####”. The meaning of these entries is
unclear.</p>
<p>SIS Login ID - The meaning of this column is unclear. It does not
appear relevant for our purposes.</p>
<p>Section - This communicates what section the student is in.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="assignment-columns">Assignment Columns:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assignment-columns"></a>
</h3>
<p>All individual assignments in Canvas grades csv contain a name and a
unique identifier ID number. For example, columns that contain
assignment scores for individual assignments will be of the form “Quiz 1
(87568490)”. Here, “Quiz 1” will be the name visible to students and
Canvas generates and adds the ID number. Also, note this ID number is
added to both assignments that originated in Gradescope and are imported
to Canvas via API and assignments that were created in an R script and
uploaded to Canvas as a csv. The number of digits in the ID is not
guaranteed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="category-columns">Category Columns:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#category-columns"></a>
</h3>
<p>Since Canvas allows users to generate aggregated categories, those
categories are given as just the category name without an ID appended.
For example, an aggregated category of Homework may have the column name
“Homework Current Score”. These columns may appear in several variations
with information appended to the column name including “Current Score”,
“Unposted Current Score”, “Final Score”, “Unposted Final Score”
depending on the options chosen by the Canvas user. Category columns are
typically read-only. Canvas grade csvs can also contain a “Final Grade”
column.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="max-points">Max Points:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#max-points"></a>
</h3>
<p>While Gradescope supplies the maximum number of points available for
each assignment as a separate column for each assignment, Canvas grade
csv gives it as a row in the data frame. The row of maximum possible
points can be identified by having “ Points Possible” as the Student
variable. While this is more space efficient, it is not a tidy data form
so it needs to be converted into Gradescope form.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="other-information">Other Information:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-information"></a>
</h3>
<p>Canvas grade csv does not contain information about when assignments
were submitted or if an assignment was late. This information is
partially supplied in the lateness.csv (discussed below). The grade csv
also does not contain email addresses (given in roster.csv) and Canvas
does not appear to use emails as keys (IDs) for students. It also does
not appear that there are any duplicated student rows in Canvas
outputs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="lateness-csv">Lateness CSV:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lateness-csv"></a>
</h2>
<p>Information on late assignments is given in this CSV. Each row in
this dataframe corresponds to a particular assignment that was submitted
late by a particular student. Thus, a particular assignment or student
can have multiple rows in the dataframe. Thus, this dataframe should be
pivoted (such as by tidyr::pivot_wider) into a format similar to
Gradescope.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="columns">Columns:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#columns"></a>
</h3>
<p>Student Name - same as Student Column in grades.csv</p>
<p>Student ID - This is the same information as the “ID” column in the
grades csv. It is the student’s canvas ID.</p>
<p>Course Name, Course ID, Section Name - These are self-explanatory and
not useful.</p>
<p>Assignment Name - the name of the assignment that was submitted
late.</p>
<p>Points Possible - This is the maximum number of points the assignment
is worth.</p>
<p>Due Date - This is the date the assignment was due. Unfortunately, it
only provides the due date and does not provide the time the assignment
was due. This is an issue when calculating lateness (to be covered
next).</p>
<p>Submitted Date - The date the assignment was submitted including the
exact time of submission with time zone.</p>
<p>Graded Date - The date and time when the assignment was graded
including the time zone.</p>
<p>Posted Date - The date and time when the assignment grade was posted
to students including the time zone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="notes">Notes:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#notes"></a>
</h3>
<p>With some data wrangling, this csv can be aggregated with the grades
csv to add lateness and submission time information, which will make the
csv more similar to a Gradescope csv.</p>
<p>However, the lack of a due time information makes it impossible to
calculate lateness with an error upper bound of less than 12 hours. My
current implementation assumes the due time is at 12:00 AM on the due
date (the least generous to students) so assignments may be marked as up
to 24 hours later than they really were. For example, if a class often
had quizzes due at 9:30 AM (perhaps assignments are due at the beginning
of lecture), a student submitted at 9:46 AM, and thus would be marked as
9 hours 46 minutes late by this assumption rather than 16 minutes late.
Note that since only assignments that were submitted late are included
in this csv, over-assumption of lateness only applies to assignments
that we submitted late. For example, a quiz submitted at 9:26 AM would
not be in the late csv and thus would not be given any lateness in our
processing.</p>
<p>As a solution, we command that lateness not be available to users
uploading information from Canvas since Canvas offers limited abilities
to apply simple late policies internally. When applied, a student’s
score in the grades csv would be after lateness was applied.</p>
<p>It appears that it may be possible to obtain a spreadsheet of
assignment due times using Canvas API (however this may be complicated).
This is worth looking into during the future so that Gradebook can
accommodate applying lateness to Canvas exported data.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="roster-csv">Roster CSV:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#roster-csv"></a>
</h2>
<p>This CSV file contains information providing student email addresses
in case we want to add them into the grading dataframe. Each row
corresponds to a particular student in the course.</p>
<p>It contains the following columns:</p>
<p>Student Name - This is in a different format than the other two CSVs.
It is in the format “First Last” as if someone wrote their name in a
typical fashion.</p>
<p>Student ID - This is the Canvas internal ID for each student.</p>
<p>Student SIS ID - This is the CalCentral id. It also contains examples
of “UID: xxxxxx” with seemingly greater frequency than the other
CSVs.</p>
<p>Email - This column contains the Student’s email address!</p>
<p>Section Name - like in other CSVs.</p>
